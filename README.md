Pipeline to automatically extract, format, and generate QA pairs from raw documents to construct LLM evaluation datasets.

## Features
- Fully automated workflow.
- Secure, scalable architecture.
- Built-in telemetry and observability.

## Technologies
- Python, HuggingFace Datasets

## Getting Started
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed on your system.

```bash
# Setup & Test
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Architecture
Please see the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md) for sequence diagrams and system design details.

## Release & Security Verification

The project includes an automated DevSecOps release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on semantic version tags (`v*.*.*`).

Each release automatically:
1. Executes test suite gates.
2. Builds the container image.
3. Performs vulnerability scanning via Trivy.
4. Generates an SPDX SBOM (`sbom.spdx.json`) using Anchore Syft.
5. Publishes a GitHub Release with attached SBOM.

### Verifying the Release
```bash
# Verify release via GitHub CLI
gh release view v0.1.0 --repo SumitDalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator

# Download and inspect SBOM
gh release download v0.1.0 --repo SumitDalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator --pattern "sbom.spdx.json"
cat sbom.spdx.json | jq .
```

## 🚀 Progressive Credential Loading & Execution Tiers

This project implements **Progressive Credential Loading (PCL)**, allowing it to run immediately out-of-the-box without external dependencies while seamlessly upgrading as credentials are provided.

### Tier 1: Zero-Config Mock Mode (Default)
Ideal for CI, testing, and rapid local evaluation.
- **Execution:** Run with default configuration (`cp .env.example .env`). Zero API keys, databases, or cloud credentials required.
- **Fallback Behavior:** In-memory caches, deterministic offline heuristics, mock vector embeddings, and local mock storage are automatically used.
- **Health Verification:** Endpoints report `{"mode": "mock"}` for unconfigured dependencies.

### Tier 2: Local Development with Live Services
Connect specific external services while keeping others mocked.
- **Execution:** Provide credentials in `.env` for the services you want active (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY, OUTPUT_DIR`).
- **Progressive Upgrade:** The runtime inspects environment variables on boot and dynamically promotes only configured modules to live mode.
- **Safe Fallback:** Any missing credentials automatically remain on mock fallbacks with no crashes or missing service errors.

### Tier 3: Production Hardened
Enterprise deployment with production-grade backends, security scans, and container distributions.
- **OCI Container Image:** Pre-built, multi-arch image on GitHub Container Registry:
  ```bash
  docker pull ghcr.io/sumitdalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator:v0.2.0
  ```
- **Production Orchestration:** Mount secrets via Kubernetes Secrets or cloud secret managers with atomic config reload support.
- **Release Verification:** Checksums and SPDX SBOM available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SumitDalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator/releases).

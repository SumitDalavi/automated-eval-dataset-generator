pytest
```

## Architecture
Please see the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md) for sequence diagrams and system design details.

## Release & Verification

The project includes an automated DevSecOps release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggered on semantic version tags (`v*.*.*`).

Each release automatically:
1. Executes test suite gates.
2. Builds the container image.
3. Performs vulnerability scanning via Trivy.
4. Generates an SPDX SBOM (`sbom.spdx.json`) using Anchore Syft.
5. Publishes a GitHub Release with attached SBOM.

### Verifying the Release
```bash
# Verify release via GitHub CLI
gh release view v0.1.0 --repo SumitDalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator

# Download and inspect SBOM
gh release download v0.1.0 --repo SumitDalavi/automated-eval-dataset-generator --pattern "sbom.spdx.json"
cat sbom.spdx.json | jq .
```
